This is a Multi Project Die (MPD) submission which contains designs created
during the FPGA Ignite Summer School 2024 at Heidelberg University. The designs
include a VGA driver with a Pixel Processing Unit (PPU) (FPGAIgnite-VGA), a
random number generator (THE RING), an application-level posit capable RISC-V
core (PERCIVAL) and a RISC-V eFPGA with custom instruction extensions (CXBex).
All designs are connected to an eFPGA created using the FABulous Framework.
